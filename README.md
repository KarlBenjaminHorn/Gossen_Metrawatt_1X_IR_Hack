# Gossen_Metrawatt_1X_IR_Hack
In this project i try to build a IR interface for my old gossen Metrahit 16S 18s and 22s.
First protobype build from scratch with things i found in my component collection.
## Requirements
1. Arduino Mega
2. IR Reciver  (i had none so i used the CNY70 optocoupler as a reciver)
3. Analog comparator (also had none so i used the MCP602 Op Amp as an comparator)
4. Sigox Comand line tool (https://sigrok.org/wiki/Downloads)
5. Resistors, 10k Poti
